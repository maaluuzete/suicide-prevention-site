        We all experience moments of stress, anxiety, or sadness and that’s okay!  
        The important thing is to <strong>not face it alone</strong>.  
        <br><br>
        You should talk to someone when you feel sad. Share your feelings with a friend, a teacher, or a family member.  
        <br><br>
        Sometimes, listening to music, drawing, or writing can help express emotions.

        Being kind is simple and it can change someone’s day.  
        <br><br>
        <strong>Empathy</strong> means understanding how others feel.  
        <br><br>
        Empathy is remembering that every human being carries an invisible struggle and deserves to find at least one heart willing to walk alongside them.  
        <br><br>
        <strong>Here are five ways to practice empathy:</strong>
        <br><br>
        <em>1. We should pay full attention to what someone is saying, without interrupting or judging, demonstrating genuine interest in their emotions and needs.</em><br>
        <em>2. We must recognize and accept another person's emotions as valid, even if we don't agree with the situation or their choices.</em><br>
        <em>3. We should think before we speak and consider whether our words might hurt someone.</em><br>
        <em>4. We must understand that sometimes the best response is a hug or a gesture of support, rather than words.</em><br>
        <em>5. A kind word or gesture can make someone's day much better.</em>
        <br><br>
        Try smiling at someone today, it costs nothing, but it can mean everything.
