        This website was created by IFMS students to promote emotional well-being and empathy.<br>
        It’s part of our English class project and a way to say:<br>
        <strong>You are not alone! 💙</strong>
      </p>

      <p class="project-note">
        This project was developed by students from class <strong>1112 of Electrotechnics</strong> as part of an English assignment.  
        Its main goal is to raise awareness about <strong>empathy, emotional care, and suicide prevention</strong>.  
        <br><br>
        We apologize for the website’s simplicity, it was made in a short amount of time, but we believe that what truly matters is the intention behind it. 🤍
      </p>
