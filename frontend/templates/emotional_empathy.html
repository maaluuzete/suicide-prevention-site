        We all experience moments of stress, anxiety, or sadness — and that’s okay!  
        The important thing is to <strong>not face it alone</strong>.  
        <br><br>
        You should talk to someone when you feel sad. Share your feelings with a friend, a teacher, or a family member.  
        <br><br>
        Sometimes, listening to music, drawing, or writing can help express emotions.

        Being kind is simple and it can change someone’s day.  
        <br><br>
        <strong>Empathy</strong> means understanding how others feel.  
        Listen when someone wants to talk. Show respect and care!  
        <br><br>
        <em>“We must respect differences.”</em><br>
        <em>“A kind word can make the world softer.”</em>
        <br><br>
        Try smiling at someone today — it costs nothing, but it can mean everything.
